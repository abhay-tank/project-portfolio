The aim was to create a website and link all our projects.

Here I have used grid to structure the website. For each project I am using 2 blocks, one for website demo using iframe and one for project description.

Upon shrinking size since it might be requested from mobile, to save data and maintain performance I've only displayed project descriptions.

Project Portfolio is hosted on github pages at https://abhay-tank.github.io/project-portfolio/
